        For their new release, they decided to pay tribute to some 
        of their favorite jazz composers, arranging the music of Wayne
        Shorter, Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane,
        Chick Corea, Thelonious Monk, Kenny Kirkland,
        Cole Porter, and the standard "Stars Fell on Alabama" by
        Frank Perkins and Mitchell Parish (although some of the 
        arrangements didn't make the cut).

        <h2>The Last Chance Trio's History</h2>
        <div class="text-div">
        <p>The Last Chance Trio is a collective made up of three (!) musicians
        who at some point called the Bay Area their home.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-div">
        <p>
        They met in 2011 when they were all part of the SFJAZZ Educational High School
        Program, and within the next year they had grown to be close musical friends-
        at times talking about the Miles Davis Second Great Quintet, 
        at others finding ways to channel the "HeadHunters" musical style.
        </p>

        Around the end of the school year of 2012, they booked a going-away 
        performance because Omree was leaving for college. About a 
        year later, during the
        summer of 2013, they booked several performances as part of the Marcelo's 
        leaving for college.
        They didn't know it would be seven whole years before
        they'd reunite and make music as a group together again.
        </p>
        <p>
        In 2020, as Marcelo and Omree lived only a few blocks from each other on MacArthur
        Street in Oakland, CA, 
        they started playing music again, and the last chance trio was
        given another chance. It was destined that they play more music together.
        Since Logan was only a few hours away (by car), they decided to bring
        the group back together and record themselves.
        The Last Chance Trio is back to doing what they do best
        with a new release - "Chance".
