        For their new release, they decided to pay tribute to some 
        of their favorite jazz composers, arranging the music of Wayne
        Shorter, Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane,
        Chick Corea, Thelonious Monk, Kenny Kirkland,
        Cole Porter, and the standard "Stars Fell on Alabama" by
        Frank Perkins and Mitchell Parish (although some of the 
        arrangements didn't make the cut).

        <h2>The Last Chance Trio's History</h2>
        <div class="text-div">
        <p>The Last Chance Trio is a collective made up of three (!) musicians
        who at some point called the Bay Area their home.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-div">
        <p>
        They met in 2011 when they were all part of the SFJAZZ High School Education
        Program, and within the next year they had grown to be close musical friends-
        often having long discussions about which were the best albums from various
        groups such as the 
        Miles Davis Second Great Quintet, 
        Herbie Hancock's funk-era albums, Dave Holland,
        the SFJAZZ Collective, Joe Henderson. As part of their interest in this 
        music, they also tried to emulate it, and would have sessions at Marcelo's 
        house in Berkeley where they would try their best to play their favorite music.

        Over the years, they had booked several shows because one of the members was about to have
        a life transition.
        Around the end of the school year of 2012, they booked a going-away 
        performance because Omree was leaving for college. About a 
        year later, during the
        summer of 2013, they booked several performances as part of the Marcelo's 
        leaving for college.
        They didn't know it would be seven whole years before
        they'd reunite and make music as a group together again.

                <h2>Logan</h2>
        <div class="text-div">
        <p>
If you hang around the Los Angeles music scene, it’s likely you’ve heard of 25 year old bassist and composer Logan Kane. He has performed on upright and electric bass with some of the highest profile artists in jazz and pop including Rostam (of Vampire Weekend), David Binney, Chris Potter, Becca Stevens, Nate Wood, Justin Brown, Capyac, Edward Simon, Roy McCurdy, Peter Erskine, John Daversa, Joel Ross, and Steve Lehman. Fueled by the excitement of the current Los Angeles renaissance, Logan Kane introduces an enigmatic and innovative compositional voice to the international jazz community. Logan often collaborates with Henry Solomon (HAIM, Big Sean, Mon Laferte) and their new album "Outside World 2" is out everywhere now! Logan is the bassist for LA Punk-Funk band Thumpasaurus

        <h2>Omree</h2>
        <div class="text-div">
        <p>Since graduating from USC, where he studied with Russell Ferrante, Alan Pasqua,
        Edwin Livingston, Greg Johnson and Aaron Serfaty, Omree has been playing gigs
        around the bay area, including a multi-year stint with the mission-based band 
        Soltron (who he connected with since some of the members played together 
        in the Latin Jazz Youth Ensemble of San Francisco). Over the past few years,
        he's been focused on writing and arranging his own music, and has released
        two albums, as well as a collection of singles. His first album, "Time Framed",
        was recorded with bay area favorites Giulio Xavier, Malachi Whitson,
        and Ahkeel Mestayer, and was recorded in the legendary Fantasy Recording Studios.</p>

        <h2>Marcelo</h2>
        <div class="text-div">
        <p>After high school, Marcelo was invited to be part of the prestigious Stamps Quintet
        at the Miami Frost School of Music, and completed his degree while
        studying with world-renowned drummers including Dafnis Prieto, [].
         He performed with Gonzalo Rubalcaba, [][].
        After completing his degree at Miami Frost, Marcelo honed his skills even 
        further by attending the New England Conservatory,
        where he studied with drummers such as Billy Hart, Rakalam Bob Moses, and [].</p>

        <h2>The Story Continues</h2>
        <div class="text-div">
        <p>
        In 2020, as Marcelo and Omree lived only a few blocks from each other on MacArthur
        Street in Oakland, CA, 
        they started playing music again, and the last chance trio was
        given another chance. It was destined that they play more music together.
        Since Logan was only a few hours away (by car), they decided to bring
        the group back together and record themselves.
        The Last Chance Trio is back to doing what they do best
        with a new release - "Chance".
